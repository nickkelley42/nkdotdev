I am a web software developer, currently employed at
[Berklee Online](https://online.berklee.edu), where I help maintain the online
learning environment.

Languages and frameworks I work with in this job include:

* [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) - the frontend framework students and 
  faculty use to interact with their courses
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - for the course backend
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - various other parts of the 
  Berklee Online website run on Rails.

This website is powered using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
